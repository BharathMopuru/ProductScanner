# Project Plan: Product Scanner API

## 1. Project Setup

- [x] Initialize a new Spring Boot application.
- [x] Configure Maven for dependency management.

## 2. API Development

- [x] Create `ScanController` to handle barcode scan requests.
- [x] Implement `ScanService` to process barcode data and interact with external APIs.
- [x] Define DTOs (`ScanRequest`, `ScanResponse`) for API communication.
- [x] Implement `AiService` for any AI-related processing (e.g., ingredient safety analysis).
- [x] Define models (`Product`, `Ingredient`, `BarcodeMonsterResponse`, `ProductResponse`).

## 3. Integration

- [x] Integrate with external barcode lookup services (e.g., Open Food Facts).
- [x] Implement OCR functionality if required for ingredient extraction.

## 4. Documentation

- [x] Edit the main README.md file to reflect both frontend and backend information.

## 5. Review

- [x] A summary of the changes made and any other relevant information.

### Summary of Changes

I have successfully created a Spring Boot application that provides an API for scanning products and retrieving information about them. The application handles barcode scan requests, processes barcode data, and interacts with external APIs. It also includes services for AI-related processing and defines necessary DTOs and models.

The application is now ready to be integrated with the frontend and tested.
