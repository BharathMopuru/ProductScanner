# Barcode Scanning React Application Requirements

## Project Overview
Build a simple, single-page React application that uses the device's camera to scan a product's barcode and sends the scanned data to a local backend service.

## Core Features
### 1. Barcode Scanning
- Access the user's system camera.
- Continuously scan the camera feed for a barcode.
- Decode the barcode to extract the barcode string.

### 2. Backend Communication
- On a successful scan, make a POST request to a local backend endpoint.
- **URL:** `/api/scan`
- **Method:** `POST`
- **Request Body:**
  ```json
  {
    "barcode": "<product_barcode>"
  }
  ```
- Handle success and error responses from the backend API.

## User Interface
- A clean, simple interface displaying the camera feed.
- A clear visual indicator or overlay to guide the user in positioning the barcode.
- Display feedback to the user (e.g., "Scanning...", "Success!", "Error, please try again").
- Gracefully handle cases where camera access is denied by the user.

## Technical Requirements
### Frontend
- **Framework:** React.js
- **Project Setup:** Initialized with Vite.
- **Dependencies:**
  - A barcode scanning library (e.g., `react-qr-reader`, `html5-qrcode`).
  - A library for making HTTP requests (e.g., `axios` or the built-in `fetch` API).
- The application should be a single-page application (SPA).

## Constraints and Considerations
- The backend is assumed to be running locally and accessible at the specified endpoint.
- The application should request camera permissions from the user.
- Error handling is important for both camera access and API requests.
- The application should provide clear user feedback throughout the process.

## MVP Scope
For the initial version, focus on:
1.  Requesting and obtaining camera permissions.
2.  Displaying the live camera feed.
3.  Detecting and decoding a barcode.
4.  Sending the decoded barcode to the backend via the specified POST request.
5.  Displaying a simple success or failure message to the user.

## Example User Flow
1.  User opens the application in their browser.
2.  The application prompts the user for camera access.
3.  The user grants permission.
4.  The application displays the camera feed.
5.  The user presents a barcode to the camera.
6.  The application automatically scans the code.
7.  The application sends the barcode data (e.g., "123456789012") to `http://localhost/api/scan`.
8.  The user sees a "Scan Successful" message on the screen.
