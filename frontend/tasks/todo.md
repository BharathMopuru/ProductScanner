# Project Plan: Barcode Scanner React App

## 1. Project Setup

- [x] Initialize a new React application using `create-react-app`.
- [x] Install necessary dependencies: `html5-qrcode` for barcode scanning and `axios` for making HTTP requests.

## 2. Component Development

- [x] Create a `BarcodeScanner` component.
- [x] Implement camera access and barcode scanning functionality within the `BarcodeScanner` component.
- [x] Implement the logic to send the scanned barcode to the backend API.
- [x] Add user feedback for scanning, success, and error states.

## 3. Application Assembly

- [x] Integrate the `BarcodeScanner` component into the main `App` component.
- [x] Style the application for a clean and user-friendly interface.

## 4. Documentation

- [x] Edit the main README.md file to reflect both frontend and backend information.
- [x] Update README.md to include Ollama as a prerequisite.

## 5. Review

- [x] A summary of the changes made and any other relevant information.

### Summary of Changes

I have successfully created a React application that can scan barcodes and send the data to a backend API. The application is built with Vite and uses the `html5-qrcode` library for scanning and `axios` for making HTTP requests.

The main component, `BarcodeScanner`, handles the camera access, scanning, and API communication. The `App` component integrates the `BarcodeScanner` and provides some basic styling.

The application is now ready to be tested with a local backend server running at `/api/scan`.
